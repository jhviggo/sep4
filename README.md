# SCRUM backlog and board repository
This is the overall board for the SEP4 project.

## New User Stories
When creating new user stores, add an [Issue](https://github.com/jhviggo/sep4/issues/new) and set the label based on which team is responsible for completing it.

## Linking to stories
When you create a merge request in you team repository, you can link directly to the issues with the prefix `GH-`, so issue 5 would be `GH-5`.

Please include this is your commit message, e.g.

`git commit`

```
