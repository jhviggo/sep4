# How do I use Github?

1. Pick up an issue from the SCRUM board by assigning yourself to it and moving it to `In progress`
2. Watch the Git Gud Workshop if you haven't already
3. Make a branch and push your code
4. Make a Pull Request based on your branch
5. Have someone review it
6. Either fix the request changes or merge it once it has been approved

## Remember to pick the correct branch for your Pull Request
